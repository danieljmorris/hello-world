Getting started with GitHub

Hello World,

After working in the architecture profession since 1999 I realized I don't have a passion for being an architect. I worked the past five years as a project manager and realized my greatest strengths revolve around customer and client service. I also realized that I was more successful once I began viewing my coworkers and team memebers as clients I am accountable to as well. I love working with clients to understand what they need and sometimes even help guide them to understanding what they need because sometimes they aren't sure themselves. I enjoy the task of taking client program requirements back to my team, breaking down the deliverable into individual work tasks and developing processes, templates and libraries to reduce time spent repeating tasks in order to lower labor costs and increase the profit margins. My greatest satisfaction was being able to ensure my teams were set up to succeed and make impossible for my superiors to argue agains giving them raises. With good planning and execution I was able to increase our workload, getting a greater share of my client's projects while our competitor's share was reduced.

I decided to enroll at Tech Elevator because I wanted to learn a skill that would open up just about any industry I am interested instead of being constrained to architecture. My logical thinking, planning and management skills are an execellent foundation for a career in software development.
